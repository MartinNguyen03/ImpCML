- models used are
    - polynomial basis expanded linea regression
    - GPT basis expansion (?)

Assessment Criteria:

- Writing quality (5 marks / 8.33%)
- Report quality (10 marks / 16.67%)
- valid experimental design (10 marks / 16.67%)
- results communication (10 marks / 16.67%)
- results quality (5 marks / 8.33%)
- theoretical analysis (5 marks / 8.33%)
- sustainability analysis (5 marks / 8.33%)

The above criteria add up to 50 marks out of a potential 60 marks (= 83%)

The remainign 10 marks can be earned by performing any **2** of the following additional analyses:

- Multiple models (5 marks / 8.33%)
    - neural networks
    - k nearest neighbours
    - decision trees
- Results nâ‰¥30 (5 marks / 8.33%)
    - changing hyperparameters (e.g. optimisation techniques, layers, mini batching, etc)
- Strong theoretical analysis (5 marks / 8.33%)
- Exceptional sustainability analysis (5 marks / 8.33%)
- Calibrated uncertainty (5 marks / 8.33%)


## Report sections:
### Abstract 
    A short paragraph describing the main aims of the paper, method investigated for achieving that aim, and briefly mentioning the key results.
### Introduction
    Sets a broader stage than the introduction. Spends a paragraph
    outlining the importance of the problem (in our case challenge datasets), a
    paragraph describing how the paper seeks to solve the problem, a paragraph
    giving the reader some details of the solution structure (e.g., what experiments
    are carried out) and a paragraph summarizing the main takeaways of the
    experiments.
### Methodology
    The mathematical foundations of any models used. This uses notation similar to what we have seen in class to orient the reader. E.g., if describing gradient descent writing it out formally and pointing out the
    hyper-parameters you are interested in like learning rate and number of epochs.
### Experimental Design
    Typically in research papers this is left to the Appendix, but in this case we are asking students to dedicate a section of their paper to describing a hypothesis they seek to test, the experiment they will run to test this,and how they will ensure their results are valid (e.g., including error bars, differentdata splits)

    
### Experimental Results
    Students will present the results of their experiments with tables or figures and describe how these plots validate or invalidate their hypothesis. Importantly: text in figures should be no smaller than font size in the main text.
### Discussion
    Students will use this section to discuss what they were able to do, highlight any experiments they wish they could have done, and provide an environmental impact assessment of the experiments that they ran
