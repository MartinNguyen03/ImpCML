- Paper attempts to refute Universal function approximation theorem mby conducting experiments on a limited number of basis expansions (polynomial)
- models used are
    - polynomial basis expanded linea regression
    - GPT basis expansion (?)

Assessment Criteria:

- Writing quality (5 marks / 8.33%)
- Report quality (10 marks / 16.67%)
- valid experimental design (10 marks / 16.67%)
- results communication (10 marks / 16.67%)
- results quality (5 marks / 8.33%)
- theoretical analysis (5 marks / 8.33%)
- sustainability analysis (5 marks / 8.33%)

The above criteria add up to 50 marks out of a potential 60 marks (= 83%)

The remainign 10 marks can be earned by performing any **2** of the following additional analyses:

- Multiple models (5 marks / 8.33%)
    - neural networks
    - k nearest neighbours
    - decision trees
- Results nâ‰¥30 (5 marks / 8.33%)
    - changing hyperparameters (e.g. optimisation techniques, layers, mini batching, etc)
- Strong theoretical analysis (5 marks / 8.33%)
- Exceptional sustainability analysis (5 marks / 8.33%)
- Calibrated uncertainty (5 marks / 8.33%)
